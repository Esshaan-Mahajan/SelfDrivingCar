# SelfDrivingCar
Designed a modeled version of self-driving car, which could navigate its path from source to destination. Algorithm uses deep 
neural network and Q-learning, to decide most optimal action.

## Introduction

A self-driving car in itself provides a revolutionary solution to the economic and ecological problems related to transportation and traffic. It can prevent car crashes, enhance traffic efficiency and promote environment friendly. Furthermore, a modelled version of a self-driving car can be a very useful tool in creating a suitable environment for training a system which is capable of learning from its surroundings. This way a system can learn about complex situations that may arise on real-life roads without actually causing nuisance on roads. 
Hence, in this project, the goal would be to create a modelled version of a self-driving car which would learn itself to drive from one point to another without any prior instructions to operate. It will learn from its surroundings and follow a road while dodging obstacles. The motive of the car would be to reach the goal destination from initial point of start. The car would explore the environment and use this knowledge to learn the appropriate path.

## Conclusion and Future work
Deep Q- learning proved out to be an efficient method to learn and execute a self-driving car. The model generated superior results while handling random situations, similar to a real car on roads. The environment allowed the user to make custom obstacles giving the car difficult challenges. The car made sensible motion from its source to destination. The next steps should be to add more moving objects in the environment.
